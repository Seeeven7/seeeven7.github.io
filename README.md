## About the Project

This is my personal Developer Portfolio Website.
At the same time it is a test for making a simple, static, website without the help of any frameworks, libraries or generators.

Is this convenient? No, but it is self dependant, does not break and needs no other skills than the basics of web development.
It is straight forward and simple although more work because you gotta do everything on your own. However, if a problem comes up its a real problem that you can eventually solve instead of getting lost in the complexities of frameworks where debugging is not easy and often you end up having to solve second level problems.

This is not against new technologies or about glorifying oldschool ways of doing something.
It is however about starting with the simplest thing that works and then iterating from there.
Starting with a tool just because it is available and widely used does not mean it is the right tool for the job and it might make things more difficult.
