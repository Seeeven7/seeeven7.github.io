      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        <b>I</b> am Chris and this is my personal Developer Portfolio. At the
        same time it is a test for making a simple, static, website without the
        help of any frameworks, libraries or static site generators.

      No

        <b>Is</b> this convenient? No, but it is self dependant, does not break
        and needs no other skills than the basics of web development. It is
        straight forward and simple although more work because you gotta do
        everything on your own. However, if a problem comes up its a real
        problem that you can eventually solve instead of getting lost in the
        complexities of frameworks where debugging is not easy and often you end
        up having to solve second level problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>This</b> is not against new technologies or about glorifying
        oldschool ways of doing something. It is however about starting with the
        simplest thing that works and then iterating from there. Starting with a
        tool just because it is available and widely used does not mean it is
        the right tool for the job and it might make things more difficult.
